# Architecture Guide

## Overview

The Containerized Modular Monolith Framework provides a balanced approach between monolithic and microservice architectures. This document explains the architectural design, principles, and implementation details.

## Core Principles

### Modular Monolith

A modular monolith is a software architecture that combines the simplicity of monolithic deployment with the modularity of microservices. Key benefits include:

- **Simplified Deployment**: The entire application is deployed as a single unit
- **Clear Module Boundaries**: Each module has well-defined interfaces and responsibilities
- **Reduced Operational Complexity**: Fewer moving parts compared to microservices
- **Easier Refactoring**: Ability to extract modules into separate services as needed

### Containerization

Containerization provides consistent environments across development, testing, and production:

- **Isolated Environments**: Each module runs in its own container
- **Consistent Dependencies**: Dependency management is simplified
- **Scalability**: Individual modules can be scaled independently
- **Portability**: Works consistently across different cloud providers

## Module Communication

Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces:

- **API Contracts**: Clear API contracts between modules
- **Event-Based Communication**: Optional event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- **Shared Libraries**: Common code is shared through internal libraries

## Deployment Models

The framework supports multiple deployment models:

- **Single Container**: All modules in one container (simplest)
- **Multiple Containers**: Each module in its own container
- **Hybrid Approach**: Critical modules separated, others combined

## Cloud Provider Integration

The framework is designed to work with multiple cloud providers:

- **AWS**: Amazon Web Services integration
- **GCP**: Google Cloud Platform integration
- **Azure**: Microsoft Azure integration
- **Custom**: Support for custom deployment environments
