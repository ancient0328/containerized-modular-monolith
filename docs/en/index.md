## Introduction

The Containerized Modular Monolith Framework provides a balanced approach between monolithic and microservice architectures. It allows you to develop a modular application that can be deployed as a single unit or as separate services, depending on your needs.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear boundaries between application modules
- **Containerization**: Consistent environments across development, testing, and production
- **Framework Flexibility**: Support for multiple frontend and backend frameworks
- **Asset Synchronization**: Efficient management of assets across different implementations
- **Cloud Provider Support**: Deployment options for AWS, GCP, Azure, and more
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization built-in from the start

## Getting Started

To get started with the framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the setup script (`node setup/init.js`)
3. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your project
4. Start developing your application

For more detailed instructions, see the [Developer Guide](./developer-guide.md).
